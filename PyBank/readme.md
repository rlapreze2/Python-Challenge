# PyBank Financial Analysis

## Overview
The PyBank project is a Python scripting challenge designed to analyze financial records for a company. Utilizing a dataset named `budget_data.csv`, which comprises two columns â€” "Date" and "Profit/Losses". This script computes various financial metrics critical for the company's financial insights and decision-making process.

## Objectives
The Python script for this challenge accomplishes the following calculations:
- The total number of months included in the dataset.
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and the average of those changes.
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

## How I Applied What I Learned
This project provided a practical application of several Python programming concepts covered in our coursework, including:

### Modules Import
Utilized the `csv` module to read from and write to CSV files, showcasing the ability to handle different file formats.

### File Operations
Demonstrated the use of Python's file operations to not only read data from a file but also to write the analysis results back to a new file - `analysis.txt`.

### Variables and Data Structures
Utilized variables to store individual data points and implemented lists to aggregate a series of data points, such as monthly changes in profit/losses. The use of lists in the script enabled efficient collection and manipulation of sequential data, demonstrating their practical application in organizing and handling dynamic datasets.

### Loops and Conditionals
Employed for loops to systematically iterate over each row in the dataset, leveraging lists to dynamically record and update monthly changes in profit/losses. Utilized conditional statements within these loops to identify and calculate the greatest increase and decrease in profits, showcasing how lists, combined with loops and conditionals, facilitate detailed data analysis and decision-making processes in Python scripts.

### Debugging
Through the development process, debugging was essential in ensuring the script ran correctly and the final output matched expected results.

## Handling Large Datasets
The challenge emphasized handling datasets too large for efficient processing in traditional spreadsheet software like Excel. This scenario highlighted Python's capability to automate data analysis tasks across large datasets, offering a scalable and more efficient solution.

## Version Control and Backup
All work was regularly committed to a Git repository and pushed to GitHub to ensure no data loss and to document the development process. This practice is crucial for collaboration and maintaining a history of changes.

## Conclusion
The PyBank project served as an excellent opportunity to apply Python programming concepts to a real-world task, reinforcing the knowledge gained in class and demonstrating the power of Python for data analysis.
