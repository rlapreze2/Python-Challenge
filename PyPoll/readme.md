# PyPoll Election Analysis

## Overview
The PyPoll project is a Python scripting challenge aimed at assisting a small, rural town in modernizing its vote-counting process. Utilizing a dataset named `election_data.csv`, which comprises three columns — "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". This script analyzes the votes and calculates various critical electoral metrics.

## Objectives
The Python script developed for this challenge accomplishes the following tasks:
- Calculates the total number of votes cast in the election.
- Generates a complete list of candidates who received votes.
- Determines the percentage of votes each candidate won.
- Calculates the total number of votes each candidate won.
- Identifies the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

## How I Applied What I Learned
This project allowed me to apply a broad range of Python programming concepts that have been covered in our coursework, specifically demonstrating the following:

### Modules Import
Employed the `csv` module to read from `election_data.csv` and to write the analytical results to a new file, showcasing proficiency in handling file formats within Python.

### File Operations
Illustrated Python's file operations, enabling me to read election data and output the analyzed results into a structured text file, `election_data_analysis.txt`.

### Variables and Data Structures
Utilized variables to capture individual data points, while the employment of lists and dictionaries played a pivotal role in effectively organizing and managing the election data. Lists were instrumental in compiling a sequential array of unique candidate names, ensuring an orderly and accessible record of all participants who received votes. Concurrently, dictionaries were utilized to dynamically map candidate names to their respective vote counts and percentages, offering a robust and flexible means to store and retrieve complex, related data sets. This dual approach of leveraging both lists and dictionaries allowed for analysis of the election results, demonstrating the capabilities of these data structures in handling and structuring large datasets within Python scripts.

### Loops and Conditionals
Employed for loops to iterate over the dataset, aggregating votes, and conditional logic to pinpoint the election winner based on vote counts, demonstrating a practical application of control flow in Python.

### Debugging
Emphasized the importance of debugging throughout the script development process to ensure accuracy in the computations and the reliability of the final outcomes.

## Efficient Data Handling
This challenge underscored the capability of Python scripts to manage and analyze large datasets, far beyond the limitations of traditional manual counting methods or spreadsheet analyses. It showcased Python's pivotal role in automating and streamlining the electoral process for enhanced accuracy and efficiency.

## Version Control and Backup
The project development was version-controlled with Git, with regular commits to a GitHub repository. This strategy ensured data integrity, facilitated backup, and supported a transparent development process—underpinning the importance of version control in collaborative and individual projects.

## Conclusion
The PyPoll election analysis project provided a significant opportunity to apply and reinforce Python programming skills in addressing a real-world challenge. It underscored the versatile application of Python in data analysis, which aligns with the course's objectives and enhances my programming competency.
